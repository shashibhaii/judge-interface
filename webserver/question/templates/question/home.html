Each question has some marks associated with it. Marks are computed as follows:-<br>
Marks=(Correct Attempts)/(Total checked attempts)

<br><br>
A player is awarded the marks associated with a question at the time of attempt. The attempt however changes the marks of the question.

This guarantees that no ties are ever encountered. Players are ranked according to score.
